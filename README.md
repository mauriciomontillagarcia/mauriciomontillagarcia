👋 Welcome to my GitHub! 

In this GitHub, you will find code, datasets, and supplementary materials related to my professional data analysis projects. Click on [**Mauricio Montilla Portfolio**](https://pumped-yttrium-b80.notion.site/Mauricio-Montilla-Portfolio-d3ca9969abe6483eb177f8e269a4ec75?pvs=74) to explore my full portfolio. I'm in the process of translating all my projects into English. If you find something in Spanish, my native language, please keep that in mind.

The rest of my repositories are personal projects focused on app development, something I enjoy as a hobby. 

**Who am I?**

My name is Mauricio Montilla, and here is a brief overview of my background:

🙋🏽‍♂️ My career has focused on data analysis and Business Intelligence consulting, leading end-to-end projects—from data extraction and transformation (ETL), to building dashboards and automating processes.

📈 I've worked in both startups and large companies, which has given me the ability to adapt to different work styles and project scopes. In every project, I aim to structure data in a way that is clear, reliable, and valuable for decision-making.

🧑🏽‍💻 On the technical side, I work with tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, and Looker Studio. I also have experience implementing CRMs (such as HubSpot and Salesforce) and improving internal workflows through data-driven solutions.
